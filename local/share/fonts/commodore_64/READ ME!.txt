Thank you for downloading the Commodore 64 Font!

The first computer I ever owned was a great little 8-bit wonder called the 
Commodore 64. Due to the hours upon hours I spent both playing games and 
learning to program (at age 12 in 1986) I gained a love for computers. 

Needless to say, I created a true type font that mimics the machine's
character set. Each symbol that was present on the original Commodore 64 
computer is available in the font. 

I added a number of dingbats when possible. The "3D" pictures of the 
Commodore 64 and 1541 Disk Drive were created from photos of my system.
A number of the dingbats are based on other dingbats available on the
Internet.


Anyway, please enjoy.

=============
Version 6.22

=============

    Windows) were set correctly.

  * The font is now properly mapped to the Windows Symbol platform
    and the Macintosh Latin platforms.    
  
  * Each character is now properly aligned and characters fit snugly  
    togather on different lines. This allows you to create Commodore 
    PET-ASCII art!

    version.
